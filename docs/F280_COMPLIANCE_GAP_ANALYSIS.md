# F280 Compliance Gap Analysis & Implementation

## Overview

This document identifies what is required for the TEUI Objective calculator to achieve
full CSA F280-12 compliance for residential HVAC equipment sizing, certification, and
licensing. The analysis maps every F280 requirement against the existing computation
graph architecture and identifies gaps that have been addressed or still remain.

CSA F280-12 (R2025) — "Determining the Required Capacity of Residential Space Heating
and Cooling Appliances" — is the Canadian standard for Part 9 building HVAC sizing,
referenced by NBC 9.33.5.1, 9.36.3.2, and 9.36.5.15.

---

## 1. What Already Existed (Pre-Implementation)

The TEUI calculator already contained 95% of the building science inputs and
calculations that map to F280 requirements, spread across 18 computation node
modules **plus existing peak load calculations in the legacy Section15.js**.

### 1.0 Existing Peak Load Calculations (Section15.js — Rows T.6.4 through T.6.8)

Section15.js already computes peak instantaneous loads using design-day ΔT:

| Row | T-ID | Legacy ID | Formula | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 137 | T.6.4 | d_137 | `(G101×D101 + D102×G102) × (H23-D23) / 1000` | kW |
| 137 | T.6.4 | l_137 | `d_137 × 3412.14245` | BTU/h |
| 138 | T.6.5 | d_138 | `(G101×D101 + D102×G102) × (D24-H24) / 1000` | kW |
| 138 | T.6.6 | h_138 | `d_138 × 0.2843451361` | Tons |
| 138 | T.6.6 | l_138 | `d_138 × 3412.14245` | BTU/h |
| 139 | T.6.7 | d_139 | enclosure cooling + internal gains + solar/vent/occ gains | kW |
| 139 | T.6.9 | h_139 | `d_139 × 0.2843451361` | Tons |
| 139 | T.6.9 | l_139 | `d_139 × 3412.14245` | BTU/h |
| 140 | T.6.8 | d_140 | `d_137 × 1000 / H15` | W/m² |
| 140 | T.6.8 | h_140 | `d_138 × 1000 / H15` | W/m² |

Where:
- G101/G102 = weighted U-values (air-facing / ground-facing)
- D101/D102 = envelope areas (air-facing / ground-facing)
- H23 = heating setpoint, D23 = coldest design temperature
- D24 = hottest design temperature, H24 = cooling setpoint
- D65+D66+D67 = plug load + lighting + equipment densities (W/m²)
- K79 = cooling solar gains, D122 = cooling ventilation gains
- K64 = cooling occupant gains, H124 = free cooling offset

These are **enclosure-only** peak loads. F280 additionally requires separate
infiltration and ventilation peak loads to arrive at the total design heat loss.

## 2. The Remaining Gap: What Section15 Doesn't Cover

Section15.js already performs peak envelope calculations (T.6.4-T.6.8) using
design-day ΔT. The gap is narrower than a full annual-to-peak conversion —
Section15 covers the **enclosure** peak loads, but F280 requires additional
components that are not in Section15:

| F280 Component | Section15 Status | What's Missing |
|---|---|---|
| Envelope peak heating | d_137 (T.6.4) — **exists** | — |
| Envelope peak cooling | d_138 (T.6.5) — **exists** | — |
| Cooling with gains | d_139 (T.6.7) — **exists** | — |
| Load intensities | d_140/h_140 (T.6.8) — **exists** | — |
| BTU/h conversions | l_137/l_138/l_139 — **exists** | — |
| Tons conversions | h_138/h_139 — **exists** | — |
| **Infiltration peak loss** | Not in Section15 | `1.21 × NRL50 × Ae/N × ΔT` |
| **Ventilation peak loss (ATRE)** | Not in Section15 | `1.21 × V × (1-ATRE/100) × ΔT` |
| **F280 total design heat loss** | Not in Section15 | envelope + infiltration + ventilation |
| **Equipment sizing check (heating)** | Not in Section15 | installed >= 100% of total |
| **Equipment sizing check (cooling)** | Not in Section15 | 80-125% of nominal |
| **Small system exception** | Not in Section15 | < 6000W threshold |
| **Designer certification** | Not in Section15 | NRCan EA, TECA, P.Eng, OAA, BCIN |
| **F280 form output** | Not in Section15 | Pages 1-3 structured report |

### Formula Reference

| Component | Annual Formula (existing) | Peak Formula (existing/new) |
|---|---|---|
| **Envelope** | `U × A × HDD × 24 / 1000` (kWh/yr) | `(Uw×Ae + Ug×Ag) × ΔT / 1000` (kW) — **exists as d_137** |
| **Infiltration** | `1.21 × NRL50 × Ae/N × HDD × 24 / 1000` (kWh/yr) | `1.21 × NRL50 × Ae/N × ΔT` (W) — **new** |

### 3.2 Computation Module (F280ComplianceNodes.js)

Located in `src/sections/nodes/F280ComplianceNodes.js`. Builds ON TOP of the existing
Section15.js peak load calculations (d_137 through d_140) rather than recalculating
the envelope peak loads.

**Relationship to Section15.js:**
- `f280.peakEnvelopeHeatLoss` reads d_137 (T.6.4) and converts kW to W
- `f280.nominalCoolingCapacity` reads d_139 (T.6.7) and adds infiltration + latent factor
- Falls back to direct computation from weighted U-values if legacy values not yet available

## 5. F280 Sizing Rules

### 5.1 Heating Equipment Sizing (CSA F280-12 §5.2.7)

```
RULE: Installed heating capacity >= Total design heat loss

  Total Design Heat Loss = Q_envelope + Q_infiltration + Q_ventilation

  Where:
    Q_envelope   = SUM(A_i × U_i × ΔT_i) × (1 + TB/100)   for all 11 components
    Q_infiltration = 1.21 × NRL50 × Ae / N × ΔT
    Q_ventilation  = 1.21 × V_dot × (1 - ATRE/100) × ΔT

  ΔT (air-facing)    = T_setpoint - T_outdoor_design
  ΔT (ground-facing) = T_setpoint - 10°C
```

**Compliance**: `heatingSizingRatio = (installedCapacity / totalDesignHeatLoss) × 100`
- PASS: ratio >= 100%
- FAIL: ratio < 100%

### 5.2 Cooling Equipment Sizing (CSA F280-12 §6.3.1)

```
RULE: 80% <= (installed / nominal) × 100 <= 125%

  Nominal Cooling = (Q_env + Q_vent + Q_inf + Q_solar + Q_internal) × LLF

  Where:
    Q_env     = U_air × A_air × ΔT_cool
    Q_vent    = 1.21 × V_dot × (1 - ATRE/100) × ΔT_cool
    Q_inf     = 1.21 × NRL50 × Ae / N × ΔT_cool
    Q_solar   = Peak solar gain estimate (orientation × SHGC × shading)
    Q_internal = Peak internal gains (occupants + plugs + lighting + equipment)
    LLF       = Latent load factor (>= 1.0, from psychrometric calculations)

  ΔT_cool = T_outdoor_design_cooling - T_setpoint_cooling

  EXCEPTION: If nominal < 6000 W (1.7 tons), installed may exceed
             nominal by up to 1750 W (0.49 tons)
```

**Compliance**: `coolingSizingRatio = (installedCapacity / nominalCooling) × 100`
- PASS: 80% <= ratio <= 125%
- PASS (small system): nominal < 6000W AND installed <= nominal + 1750W
- FAIL: ratio < 80% OR ratio > 125%

### 5.3 Room-by-Room Requirements (F280 §5.2.6)

For Room-by-Room compliance type:
- Heating delivery to each room must be >= 100% of that room's design heat loss
- This requires room-level area/U-value/ventilation allocation (not yet implemented)

---

## 6. Remaining Gaps for Full F280 Compliance

### 6.1 New Input Fields Needed (6 fields)

These inputs are defined in `f280-input-summary.json` as needed but not yet connected to UI:

| Field | Description | Priority | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `f280.building.postalCode` | Postal code of building | High | Currently climate uses province+city, not postal code |
| `f280.building.lotNumber` | Lot identification number | Medium | Administrative field for form output |
| `f280.building.waterTableDepth` | Water table depth (m) | Low | Refines below-grade heat loss; rarely affects sizing significantly |
| `f280.building.slabFluidTemp` | Slab fluid temperature (°C) | Low | Only for radiant floor slab systems |
| `f280.installedHeatingCapacity` | Rated heating output (W) | High | Input exists in graph, needs UI connection |
| `f280.installedCoolingCapacity` | Rated cooling output (W) | High | Input exists in graph, needs UI connection |

### 6.2 Peak Solar Gain Refinement

**Current**: The peak solar gain is approximated by dividing seasonal solar gains by
cooling season hours and applying a 2.5x peak factor. This is a reasonable estimate
but not the exact F280 method.

**F280 Method**: Uses hourly peak solar radiation values by orientation from ASHRAE
tables or weather data. For each glazing orientation, the peak-hour solar radiation
(W/m2) is multiplied by area × SHGC × shading factor.

**Recommendation**: Add peak solar radiation lookup table by orientation per
climate region, sourced from ASHRAE Fundamentals or CWEC weather files.

### 6.3 Peak Internal Gains Refinement

**Current**: Approximated from seasonal internal gains divided by 8760 hours with
a 1.5x peak factor.

**F280 Method**: Uses instantaneous occupant + equipment + lighting loads at peak
conditions. The existing `InternalGainsNodes.js` already has activity-level wattages
per person (96.71W relaxed to 424.95W hyperactive) and equipment load tables — these
could be used directly for peak values.

**Recommendation**: Wire the existing per-person wattage and equipment load values
directly into the F280 peak gain calculation, bypassing the seasonal integration.

### 6.4 Room-by-Room Calculations

**Current**: Only "Whole House" compliance type is supported.

**F280 Requirement**: Room-by-Room mode (F280 Form Page 3) requires:
- Individual room definitions (up to 40 rooms)
- Per-room envelope component allocation (wall area, window area, etc.)
- Per-room infiltration allocation
- Per-room ventilation allocation
- Per-room heat loss subtotals
- Room-level equipment sizing check: delivery >= 100% of room heat loss

**Recommendation**: This is a substantial feature requiring a room-level data model.
It would involve:
1. Room definition input array (name, area, volume)
2. Component-to-room allocation matrix
3. Per-room peak load calculations (reusing the component-level formulas)
4. Per-room equipment delivery inputs
5. Per-room sizing compliance checks

### 6.5 F280 Form Output Generation (Pages 1-3)

**Current**: Parnas tables and computation nodes calculate all values but no
PDF/print-ready F280 form output exists.

**F280 Requirement**: The output must match the official F280 Form Set (v24.10)
format with three pages:
- **Page 1**: Designer info, project details, certification marks
- **Page 2**: Input summary table (all building parameters)
- **Page 3**: Results summary (total heat loss, room breakdown if applicable)

**Recommendation**: Add an F280 form renderer that:
1. Pulls all values from the computation graph via semantic paths
2. Formats them into the official F280 form layout
3. Generates a printable/PDF output matching the FormSet v24.10 format
4. Includes designer attestation and certification marks

### 6.6 Verified Software Compliance

**Current**: The TEUI calculator is not listed as CSA F280-12 verified software.

**F280 Requirement**: Calculations must be conducted using CSA F280-12 verified
software. The verification process involves submitting test cases to CSA Group
for validation.

**Recommendation**: This is a business/certification process, not a code change:
1. Prepare standardized test cases per CSA F280-12 Annex D
2. Validate calculator outputs against reference implementations (HOT2000, TECA QF)
3. Submit for CSA verification through the HVAC Designers of Canada process
4. Until verified, F280 outputs should be clearly labeled as "FOR REFERENCE ONLY"

## 8. Architecture Notes

### 8.1 How F280 Builds on Section15 Peak Loads

F280ComplianceNodes.js builds ON TOP of the existing Section15.js peak calculations.
It reads the legacy d_137/d_139 values and adds the missing components:

### 8.2 Incremental Recomputation

Because F280 nodes are registered in the same computation graph as all other nodes,
they benefit from the existing incremental recomputation (topological sort + dirty
flag propagation). Changing a single U-value automatically propagates through to:
1. The annual heat loss (existing)
2. The F280 peak heat loss (new)
3. The F280 total design heat loss (new)
4. The F280 heating sizing compliance (new)
5. The F280 overall compliance status (new)

### 8.3 Provincial Code Reference Mapping

| Province | Code Section | F280 Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Ontario | OBC 9.33.2.2 | Mandatory for residential heating/cooling capacity |
| British Columbia | BCBC 9.33.5 | Required for building permits; Step Code checklists |
| Alberta | NBC 2023 Alberta 9.33.5.1 | Referenced for mechanical system sizing |
| National | NBC 9.33.5.1, 9.36.3.2, 9.36.5.15 | F280 is the referenced standard for Part 9 HVAC |
